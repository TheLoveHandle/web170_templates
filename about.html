    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>If you have come to this page, odds are you expect me to tell you some things about my life. Well, I was 22 when I last updated this site. If you don't know when that was, look at the bottom of the page. I love video games, laser tag, food, sleep, and girls. I do currently need some more friends to come play laser tag with me. If you are interested, take a look at virtualsports.net. My groups name is _______(can't remember right now, will update) and we play on Saturdays. Things I do not like, a lot of vegetables, all seafood, mornings, losing at anything, and break ups.</p>

    <p>That's all you really need to know about me. Feel free to email me with questions, or if you want to just chat.</p>
